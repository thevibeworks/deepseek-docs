# Speech to Text

Transcribe an audio file into text, for example for voice input in a chatbot.

`POST https://api.deepseek.com/v1/tools/asr`

The whole audio file is sent in one request and the complete transcript is returned. Streaming recognition is not supported.

---

## Languages

Chinese (`zh`), Cantonese (`yue`), English (`en`), Japanese (`ja`), Korean (`ko`), German (`de`), French (`fr`), Spanish (`es`), Portuguese (`pt`), Italian (`it`), Russian (`ru`), Arabic (`ar`), Hindi (`hi`), Indonesian (`id`), Vietnamese (`vi`), Thai (`th`), Turkish (`tr`), Malay (`ms`), Filipino (`fil`), Polish (`pl`) and Hungarian (`hu`).
